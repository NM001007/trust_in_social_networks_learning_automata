# Producing Trusted Graphs in Online Social Networks using Learning Automata (Implementation of a paper)

## Description of the Project
People have been increasingly using online social networks (OSNs) to socialize and stay in touch with their friends, family members, colleagues or other ones around the world. To increase consumers' quality of service and experience, OSNs require trust evaluation models and algorithms. Graph-based techniques account for the majority of known ways in which the trust value is derived using a trusted graph. This project is an implementation of the paper entitled _"An automata algorithm for generating trusted graphs in online social networks"_ which combines graph-based and artificial intelligence methodologies to develop a hybrid model for enhancing OSN coverage and accuracy.

## Datasets
The implemented algorithm has been experimented on two datasets, containing trust relations between users, obtained from real-world social networks named Advogato and BitCoin.
